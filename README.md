Prompt
======

Prompt is a programming language based on relational ai prompts. It's useful because it helps you chain multiple ai sessions together (REPL loops in programming lingo), and weave them into the programming tools you already know. Prompt is a tiny language, you can learn it in less than fifteen minutes.
