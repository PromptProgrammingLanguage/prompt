# This isn't done yet, the current crop of LLM website automators preparse the
# DOM into a more basic structure for the LLM to handle. I had the nutty idea
# that we should have the user describe what they want to automate, and then
# have our AI write a Puppeteer script to accomplish that specific task. I've
# not got it working yet, but I've not tried that hard yet. So for now, we
# leave this as an excercise for you dear user.
