# When prompting an LLM to generate tables of data, they can sometimes

# asking if the input is valid JSON, and then using a shell command to
# invoke NodeJS's table method if the answer is yes.

        Answer this question with a yes or no answer. Is this input valid JSON
        that can be used with Nodes console.table method cleanly?

    match $AI {
        (?i:^yes) => `node --eval "console.table(JSON.parse('$USER'))"`
    }
