/*
    When prompting an LLM to generate tables of data, they can sometimes
    generate inconsistent results. We can use Prompt to work around this by
    asking if the input is valid JSON, and then using a shell command to
    invoke NodeJS's table method if the answer is yes.

        Answer this question with a yes or no answer. Is this input valid JSON
        that can be used with Nodes console.table method cleanly?
